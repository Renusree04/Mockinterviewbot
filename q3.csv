Label,Ans
Right,The data items in a multidimensional array are stored in the form of rows and columns
Wrong,Not sure
RIght,The elements in multidimensional arrays can be stored in linear storage using two methods that is in row-major order or column-major order
Wrong,Array are not represented by braces in codes
Right,The memory is allocated for the multidimensional array in contiguous form
Right,A two-dimensional array is a tabular representation of data in which the elements are kept in rows and columns
Right, M X N elements are arranged in M rows and N columns to form a two-dimensional array
Wrong,Not known
Wrong,The size of every dimension in the multidimensional array needs not to be declared initially
Right,To access any location to place the element in a two-dimensional array provide the row and column location in the code
Wrong,Pointers are not used for allocation
Wrong,I dont really know
Right,An array elements are always stored in sequential memory locations
Wrong,Elements can be stored without indexing
Wrong,Its similar to general programming language
Wrong,Im not sure
Right,The purpose of arrays is to enable random access so it must be possible to go from an array index to the memory address of the value
Right,Wrong arrangement
Wrong,While indexing the number in the first set of brackets represent columns and second represents rows
Right,Each cell in a two dimensional array can be accessed array through two indexes that can specify the row number and column number respectively accessed and is represented in a matrix form or tabular form
Wrong,Brackets can be removed while indexing
Right,If the size of the declared array is more than the required size then  it can lead to memory wastage
Wrong,I dont really know
Right,To declare a 2D array  specify the type of elements that will be stored in the array

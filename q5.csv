Label,Ans
Wrong,Confused about the correct answer
Wrong,Not sure
Right,To discover its characteristics in order to evaluate its suitability for various applications or compare it with other algorithms for the same application
Wrong,There are no too many influencing factors
Right,Algorithm analysis is an important part of computational complexity theory  which provides theoretical estimation for the required resources of an algorithm to solve a specific computational problem
Right,To predict the behavior of an algorithm without implementing it on a specific computer
Wrong,It is not impossible to predict the exact behavior of an algorithm
Wrong,I dont really know
Wrong,An algorithm in data mining  or machine learning is a set of heuristics and calculations that creates a model from data
Right,We can compare them to determine the best one for our purpose when we calculate the lower bound
Right,The analysis is a process of estimating the efficiency of an algorithm
Wrong,Not sur
Right,It would be best to analyze every algorithm in terms of Time that relates to which one could execute faster and Memory corresponding to which one will take less memory
Right,Analysing algorithms allow us to process that data in a meaningful way
Right,An algorithm should have 0 or more well-defined inputs
Wrong,I dont really know
Right,It is much more convenient to have simple measures for the efficiency of an algorithm
Wrong,Linear Regression is a method of measuring the relationship between two continuous variables
Wrong,Space complexity is the key criteria
Right,Define the input for which algorithm takes less time or minimum time
Right,There are too many influencing factors
Wrong,no idea
Right,to implement the algorithm and test the efficiency every time a certain parameter in the underlying computer system changes
Right,It's accuracy is increased and potential mistakes are minimized

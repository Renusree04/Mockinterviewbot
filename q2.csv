Label,Ans
Wrong ,Means the fixed action performed
Wrong ,Dynamic data allocation can be also done similar to static
Right,In Dynamic data structure the size of the structure in not fixed and can be modified during the operations performed on it
Wrong ,It’s the same as static data structure
Right,Dynamic data structures are designed to facilitate change of data structures in the run time
Right,For dynamic data structures memory is not provided contiguously so users have to provide an external structure to store the location
Right,Dynamic data structures are data structures that grow and shrink as you need them to by allocating and deallocating memory from a place called the heap
Wrong ,I dont really know
Wrong ,Not sure
Right,Dynamic Data Structure is that kind of data structure that changes its size during runtime
Wrong ,A dynamic data structure is an organization or collection of data in memory which have a fixed size
Right,The values stored in the data structure can be changed easily either it be static or dynamic data structure
Right,A dynamic data structure (DDS) refers to an organization or collection of data in  memory that has the flexibility to grow or shrink in size enabling a programmer to control exactly how much memory is used
Wrong ,It means energetic or capable of changing in science terms
Right,Dynamic data structures stand in contrast to static data structures (SDS) wherein in the case of the latter the size of the structure is fixed
Right,Dynamic data structures provide easy access to elements
Right,It can be modified during the operations performed on it
Wrong ,No idea
Wrong ,The dynamic characteristic shows the compilation of the data
Right,A dynamic data structure is a type of data structure that has the ability to change its size as per the requirement of storage
Right,This means that the size of the data structure is not fixed and it may shrink with the utilization of memory
Right,The size of the data structure can be modified after initialization
Wrong ,Not sure
Wrong ,It can store a limited amount of elements or data in it
